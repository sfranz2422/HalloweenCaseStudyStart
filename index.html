    <h1>Welcome to my site. Please come in and stay awhile.</h1>
    <p>I started this web site because Christmas has always been my favorite holiday. But during the last year, I started selling some of my favorite Christmas products, and they've become quite a hit.

If you click on the Personal link, you can browse my favorite Christmas pictures, stories, and films. And if you join my email list, I will keep you up-to-date on all things Christmas

    	<li><a href="products/decorations.html">Decorations</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>My guarantee</h3>
    <p>If you aren't completely satisfied with everything you buy from my site, you can return it 
    	for a full refund. <strong>No questions asked!</strong></p>
