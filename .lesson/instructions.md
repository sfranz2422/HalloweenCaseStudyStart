# Halloween Case Study Start


Fork [this](https://replit.com/@StephenFranz1/HalloweenCaseStudyStart#index.html) file and rename to: 

"[yourname] Halloween Project"

I will also post this link on Google Classroom.  When you are finished with the project submit the link to your project to Google Classroom.  

Make sure you commit your project as soon as you fork it and commit often to avoid losing your work.  

You will use this same project file to improve this page throughout the semester.
